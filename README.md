# Sorting Algorithms Visualized

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/0jmRWZLn/Capture.png" alt="">

Now you can see how sorting algorithms work by watching them in real time. You can change the input size and the 
sorting speed. When the algorithm is running `comparisons` and `array accesses` are updating in real time. 
If you want to learn these algorithms, learning them on paper is good practice but for a more intuitive way 
I also recommend their visualization.

## About

The project is build with `Processing` java library.

### Sorting Algorithms :
```
• Bubble Sort
• Insertion Sort
• Selection Sort
• Quick Sort
* Merge Sort
* Heap Sort
* Radix Sort
* Counting Sort
* Pigeonhole Sort
```
## How To Run

To run the project, download the binaries under [releases](https://github.com/StamateValentin/SortingAlgorithms/releases)
and open the .jar file. There are two versions: with and without opengl enabled. Try first the opengl version and if it's
not working try the other one.

To build the project on your machine, you will need the `libs` folder located in the root directory that contains
all the necessary libraries, except processing library that is imported via Gradle. This folder can be found under releases.

### Libraries :

* [Processing](https://processing.org)
* [ControlP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5)
* [Sound](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/sound)
