# Sorting Algorithms Visualized

<img width="1000" src="https://i.postimg.cc/B69Wdvkg/Capture.png" alt="">

Now you can see how sorting algorithms work by watching them in real time. You can change the input size and delay, and when the algorithm is running the `comparisons` and `array access` are updating for a better view. If you want to learn these algorithms, watching their code is a good practice but for a better understanding I also recommend their visualization. 

## About

The project is write in Java 8 together with Processing.
Because recursive algorithms cannot be visualized only by iteration, I used `threads` for every algorithm.

Sorting Algorithms :
```
• Bubble Sort
• Insertion Sort
• Selection Sort
• Quick Sort
* Merge Sort
* Heap Sort
* Radix Sort
* Counting Sort
* Pigeonhole Sort
```
## How To Run

### Must Have :

* [Processing](https://processing.org/)
* [ControlP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/)

To compile and run the project, open the Sketch folder and open Sketch.pde file with Processing.
If you are on Linux, download `Processing` and put the library `ControlP5` under modes/java/libraries . Open processing via terminal then press `File` and `Open...`.

To run directly, download the binaries under under [releases](https://github.com/StamateValentin/SortingAlgorithms/releases). The binaries are available for Win64 and Linux64.
